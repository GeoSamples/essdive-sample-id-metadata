Header|Object Type|objectType|Mandatory (SESAR)|Object type of sample or specimen. |Use controlled list. **Requesting additional terms be added to list: filtrate, material captured in filter, organism. See: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kBETFbNoMfkgxbVhqiEJppCT2GaZYJUywucSKdblVJM/edit#gid=625226234|Core; Individual Sample
Header|User Code|userCode|Mandatory (SESAR)|User code to be used as prefix for IGSNs to be assigned or assigned by user in the submitted batch template.|If assigning IGSNs in the IGSN column, the user code must match the user code in the IGSNs. For example, if the user specifies IEMEG is the user code, any user-specified IGSNs must begin with IEMEG. If you do not specify the user code to be used, a default user code belonging to the registrant will be used.|IEMEG
Description|Sample Name|sampleName|Mandatory (SESAR)|Collector's project-specific sample name, which must be unique for each sample that you are submitting. Mandatory.|This Sample Name is a place where you can develop a sample ID that has meaning to you and may help in your internal, project sample management.|001-ER18-FO
Description|Other name(s)|otherName|Optional|Other sample name(s) that have been used in the past. |Use a semi-colon to delimit multiple names where needed.|001ER18FO; 001ER18-FO
Description|IGSN|IGSN|Recommended|Leave blank if you want SESAR to assign the IGSN, which is recommended. |For split samples/subsamples, you can assign your own 1-2 character extensions from the Parent IGSN, and submit your own IGSNs for registering these child samples.  This is not required, but is an option if desired. For assigning your own IGSNS, you must use upper-case alpha-numeric characters. |IEMEG0001
Description|Parent IGSN|parentIGSN|Required, if relevant|The larger sample from which a child sample was derived. For example, a core section may be the parent of a series of subsamples or split samples. Parent and child samples are linked in the SESAR catalog. Sibling samples are inferred from parent-child relationships and are linked on the landing page for a sample.    |Leave blank if a parent IGSN does not exist. |IEMEG0002
Description|Release Date|releaseDate|Required - defaults to current date if not specified|Date when sample metadata should be publicly accessible and searchable. If null, defaults to date of registration in SESAR (recommended). |SESAR recommends that sample metadata become public within 2 years of sample registration.|3/15/18

Description|Collection method description|collectionMethodDescription|Required|Free text description of the collection method for the sample. Include any important terms and details for potential users to understand how your sample was collected.|free-text. Collection methods may often be the same across a series/collection of samples; there are two options for providing collection method details at a higher level. Option 1:  Create a separate file with metadata to describe a sample collection, which contains a "collectionID", and any associated metadata fields (e.g. "collectionMethodDescription", "Purpose", "Chief Scientist", etc.).  Option 2: Create a methods file, with a series of methods descriptions that are each associated with a "methodID" and an associated "methodDescription." |Example 1) "Collect soil samples from top 10 cm using 2-3 cores from with meadow plot or under the bulk of tree/shrub canopies."

Additional Fields for ESS-DIVE|Not represented|biome|Recommended|Report which major environmental system your sample or specimen came from. The systems identified should have a coarse spatial grain, to provide the general environmental context of where the sampling was done (e.g. were you in the desert or a rainforest?). |We recommend using subclasses of ENVO‚Äôs biome class: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO\_00000428.

Additional Fields for ESS-DIVE|Not represented|collectionID|Optional|A unique identifier for the set of information associated with a collection of samples; collections may be organized around a particular project, data set, field season, region, site, etc. A collection identifier can be used to link a set of samples together, and/or to enable efficient entry of metadata that is the same across all samples in a "sample collection." |Must be unique within the data package (project-assigned, and does not need to be globally unique). See link to diagram that demonstrates linking related collection, site, event, and sample IDs.  |WSFA\_June2019
Additional Fields for ESS-DIVE|Not represented|eventID|Optional|A unique identifier for the set of information associated with an Event (something that occurs at a place and time). An event identifier can be used to link a set of samples collected on a specific date,  and/or to enable efficient entry of metadata that is the same across these samples.|Must be unique within the data package (project-assigned, and does not need to be globally unique).

Additional Fields for ESS-DIVE|Not represented|siteID|Optional|A unique identifier for the set of site location information. May be a global unique identifier or an identifier specific to the data set.

Additional Fields for ESS-DIVE|Not represented|coordinateUncertaintyInMeters|Recommended|The horizontal distance (in meters) from the given decimalLatitude and decimalLongitude describing the smallest circle containing the whole of the Location. Leave the value empty if the uncertainty is unknown, cannot be estimated, or is not applicable (because there are no coordinates). Zero is not a valid value for this term. In most cases, a value reflecting the precision and accuracy of the GPS instrument used to obtain coordinates is appropriate here.  Many GPS instruments will provide a precision along with coordinates that can be applied here.  | |30 (reasonable lower limit of a GPS reading under good conditions if the actual precision was not recorded at the time)
