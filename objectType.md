#ESS-DIVE Proposed Object Type Vocabulary

We have modified the original SESAR IGSN list of [object type terms](https://www.geosamples.org/help/vocabularies#object) for Environmental Systems Science Samples. Currently, **you must use SESAR terms** to register samples for IGSNs. Please provide feedback on any additional terms needed, modifications to definitions needed, or terms that should be removed.

:-----------------------|:--------------------|:-----
Core                    |Core                 |long cylindrical cores
Core Section            |Core Section         |arbitrarily cut segments of a "core"
Cuttings                |Cuttings             |loose, coarse, unconsolidated material suspended in drilling fluid.
Dredge                  |Dredge               |a group of rocks collected by dragging a dredge along the seafloor.
Experimental Specimen   |Experimental Specimen|a synthetic or natural material used during an experiment
Grab                    |Grab                 |a sample (sometimes mechanically collected) from a deposit or area, not intended to be representative of the deposit or area.
Material Sample         |Individual Sample    |a sample that is an individual unit, including rock hand samples, a biological specimen, or a bottle of fluid.
Filtrate                |NA                   |sample that has gone through a filtration process to separate solids from fluids (liquids or gases), using a filter medium through which only the fluid can pass. Must be associated with a filter size. 
Material Captured in Filter|NA                |a material sample captured in filter, for example from a water sample that was filtered. Must be associated with filter size field. Material options include: "particulate matter" or "particulate matter: organic particulate matter" .
Organism                |NA                   |A specimen of a biological organism. 
Part of organism        |NA                   |A specimen of a portion of a biological organism (e.g. leaf, root, stem)
Collection of organisms |NA                   |A material entity that consists of two or more organisms, viruses, or viroids.
Site                    |Site                 |a place where a sample is collected.
