# ESS-DIVE Sample ID and Metadata Standard

ESS-DIVE recommends registering samples for [International Geo/General Sample Numbers (IGSNs)](https://www.geosamples.org/aboutigsn) through the [System for Earth Sample Registration (SESAR)](https://www.geosamples.org/). IGSNs are associated with standardized metadata to characterize a variety of different samples and their collection details. These sample identifiers facilitate sample discovery, tracking, and reuse; they are especially useful when sample data is shared with collaborators, sent to different labs or user facilities for analyses, or distributed in different data files, datasets, and/or publications. 

ESS-DIVE has worked with community scientists to test use of IGSNs and associated metadata in interdisciplinary Environmental Systems Science. We therefore have specific recommendations for extending IGSN metadata for this interdisciplinary community.

## About the Sample ID and metadata standard

Stay tuned for a link to our related paper describing the sample ID and metadata standard. 

## How to contribute

The purpose of this standard is to support ESS scientists in sample data management, discovery, and reuse. The standard should be useful and practical for this community. We therefore solicit feedback on suggested improvements and any aspect of the standard that does not work well for you.

You can contribute by [submitting an issue](https://github.com/ess-dive-community/essdive-community-repo-guide#how-to-contribute) directly in this github repository (preferred method), or by contacting us at ess-dive-support@lbl.gov.
